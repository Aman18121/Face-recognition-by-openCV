# Face-recognition-by-openCV

This project utilizes OpenCV and deep learning techniques for real-time face recognition. It involves face detection, feature extraction, and classification using models like Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or deep learning-based approaches (e.g., DNN, FaceNet). The system captures face data, processes it using OpenCVâ€™s built-in libraries, and identifies individuals by comparing features against a trained dataset. Applications include security systems, attendance tracking, and identity verification. The project can be enhanced with Haar cascades, Dlib, or CNNs for improved accuracy.
