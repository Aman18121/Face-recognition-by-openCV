# Face-recognition-by-openCV

This project implements a real-time face verification system using OpenCV and DeepFace. It captures live video from a webcam and compares each frame to a reference image for identity verification.

🔹 Key Features:
✔️ Real-time face detection and verification
✔️ Uses DeepFace for facial recognition
✔️ Multi-threading for efficient processing
✔️ Displays match results dynamically on the screen
✔️ Simple and interactive interface

📌 Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, DeepFace, Threading
